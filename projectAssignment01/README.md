# Project Assignment01: Project Proposal 

## Research Question:

### **"What are the most successful video games and what common traits among them can be incorporated into gamified learning?"** 

My research question is motivated by my own interests as to how learning and education can be gamified. Taking inspiration from recreating gaming, I would like to investigate the most successful video games under various metrics such as time spent playing, players who completed the game and extra content, review scores, and sales. After concluding which games can be deemed successful, we can begin meta-analysis of common traits amongst these games, why they were successful, and what aspects can be incorporated into gamified learning. 

## Why? 

As someone who is intersted in design, gamification, and evolving pedagogical methods, I think that gamification is an emerging way to faciliate teaching and learning. Especially in recent times when gaming has expanded as a recreational pasttime, there is no better time than to look to video games for new inspiration for developing teaching tools! One of the most powerful aspects of teaching is motivation, and I think that gamification is promising way to faciliate motivation in students. My own areas of interest are language pedagogy, but with some inspiration and help from the great titles, I hope that we can uncovers ways to inprove teaching across multiple disciplines. 


## The Data: 

I will be working with the CORGIS Video Games dataset which can be found [here.](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/python/video_games/) This dataset covers thousands of video game titles that were released between 2004 and 2010. Each title has information including ratings, sales, and time taken to complete content. 

## Scope 

Across the thousands of games from the CORGIS dataset, I plan to analyze "succcess" of titles uner varying metrics. This of course will include looking at games that were not considered successful. Visualizations would primarily include figures that describe both title specific information as well as grouping titles based on their commonalities of success or failure. A healthy part of this project will also include meta-analysis of titles that are considered successes or failures, from various lenses such as cultural, aesthetic, or other qualitative perspectives. Additional datasets or quantative information may supplement analyses and will be specified as they arise. 

## Conclusion 

I hope that from this project I can gain some persepctive of what makes a "good" game, and how any traits of such games can be included in gamified teaching. Additionally, I hope to develop my skills in working with datasets, as well as the tools needed to analyze them and create meaningful visualizations. Througout this project I would like to improve being abke to transform raw data into meaningful conclusions that are supplemented by data visualizations.
