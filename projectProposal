# Project Assignment01: Project Proposal 

## Research Question 
My research question is motivated by my own interests as to how learning and education can be gamified. Taking inspiration from recreating gaming, I would like to investigate the most successful video games under various metrics such as time spent playing or players who completed the game and extra content. After concluding which games can be deemed successful, we can begin meta-analysis of common traits amongst these games, why they were successful, and what aspects can be incorporated into gamified learning. 

** What are the most successful video games and what common traits among them can be incorporated into gamified learning? **
